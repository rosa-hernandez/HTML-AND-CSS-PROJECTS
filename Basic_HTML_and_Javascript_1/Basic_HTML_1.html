<p><font color="008B8B" face="impact" size="5">...now that we have technologized our enviorment 
		and isolated the self within a 
		scientific frame of mind, we no
        longer turn to nature to echo
        our state. Now we catch our 
        reflections, even our spirits,
        in the movements and mentations
        of machines.
